# Daily Time Tracking Feature Specification

## Overview
Implement daily-based time tracking that separates each day's activities into distinct log pages while maintaining the ability to view previous days' data.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Daily Separation
- **Always start a new log page for each day**: When the app starts or when the date changes, create a fresh view for the current day
- **Date-based data organization**: Group all activities by date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Automatic day transition**: Detect when the date changes and automatically switch to a new day's log

### 2. Navigation Between Days
- **Day selector**: Add navigation controls to switch between different days
- **Previous days access**: Allow users to view historical data from any previous day
- **Date picker or calendar**: Provide an intuitive way to jump to specific dates
- **Today button**: Quick way to return to the current day's log

### 3. Daily Summary Features
- **Per-day totals**: Show total time tracked for each specific day
- **Daily productivity metrics**: Calculate productive vs unproductive time per day
- **Day comparison**: Allow comparison between different days
- **Weekly/monthly aggregation**: Option to view aggregated data across multiple days

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Clear date indication**: Always show which day's data is currently being viewed
- **Day navigation controls**: Previous/Next day buttons, date picker
- **Daily statistics panel**: Show key metrics for the selected day
- **Empty state handling**: Proper messaging when no data exists for a selected day
