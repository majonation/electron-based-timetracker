# Timezone Fix Summary - October 14, 2025

## Problem
At 11:40 PM PT (Pacific Time), the app was displaying "Today" with tomorrow's date (October 15) instead of the current date (October 14). This was because the app was using UTC time for date calculations, and at 11:40 PM PT, it's already 6:40 AM UTC the next day.

## Root Cause
The application had timezone issues in two places:

### 1. Backend (src/db.js)
- `getDateString()` was using `toISOString().split('T')[0]` which returns UTC date
- `getDayBoundaries()` was parsing dates in a timezone-aware way that caused mismatches

### 2. Frontend (src/renderer.js)
- 12 different places were using `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for date string generation
- This caused the "Today" label to show the wrong date near midnight

## Solution

### Backend Fix (src/db.js)
```javascript
// OLD - Returns UTC date
function getDateString(timestamp) {
  const date = new Date(timestamp);
  return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}

// NEW - Returns local date
function getDateString(timestamp) {
  const date = new Date(timestamp);
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
```

### Frontend Fix (src/renderer.js)
Added a helper function and replaced all UTC date references:

```javascript
function getLocalDateString(date = new Date()) {
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
```

Replaced all 12 occurrences of:
- `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` → `getLocalDateString()`
- `date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` → `getLocalDateString(date)`

## Impact
- ✅ "Today" now correctly shows October 14 at 11:40 PM PT
- ✅ Data for October 14 is correctly displayed under "Today"
- ✅ Date navigation works correctly across timezone boundaries
- ✅ Day change detection at midnight works correctly in local time

## Files Modified
1. `src/db.js` - Backend date functions
2. `src/renderer.js` - Frontend date functions
3. `timezone-bug-fixing.md` - Detailed technical documentation
4. `implementation.md` - Updated task checklist

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Open the app at any time of day
2. Check that "Today" shows the current local date
3. Check that tracking data for today is displayed
4. Navigate between dates and verify correct data is shown

## Note
The app should now work correctly regardless of timezone or time of day. The key principle is: **always use local time components for date strings, never use UTC time via toISOString()**.
