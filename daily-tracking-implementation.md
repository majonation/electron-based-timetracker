# Daily Time Tracking Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Database Layer Updates
- [x] Review existing database schema and functions
- [x] Add date-based utility functions for day boundaries
- [x] Create daily aggregation functions
- [x] Add date filtering to existing queries
- [x] Test database functions with sample data

## Phase 2: Backend API Updates  
- [x] Add IPC handlers for daily data retrieval
- [x] Create daily statistics calculation functions
- [x] Add date navigation API endpoints
- [x] Update preload.js with new API methods

## Phase 3: Frontend UI Components
- [x] Create date navigation component (Previous/Next/Today buttons)
- [x] Add date display showing current selected day
- [x] Create daily statistics panel
- [x] Add date picker for jumping to specific dates

## Phase 4: Data Display Updates
- [x] Modify existing app list to show daily data
- [x] Update renderer.js to handle date-based data loading
- [x] Add empty state handling for days with no data
- [x] Implement automatic refresh for current day

## Phase 5: Integration & Polish
- [ ] Ensure app always starts with "today" view
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between days
- [ ] Update existing reset functionality to work with daily views
- [ ] Add loading states for date navigation

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test with multiple days of data
- [ ] Test edge cases (midnight transitions, empty days)
- [ ] Update main implementation.md
- [ ] Document new features and usage

## Critical Bug Fixes (Completed)
- [x] **Day Transition Bug**: Fixed automatic day switching when app runs across multiple days
  - Added day change detection in auto-refresh and window focus handlers
  - App now automatically switches to new day when date changes
  - Updated navigation buttons when day transitions occur
- [x] **Time Accuracy Bug**: Fixed inaccurate time counting that was missing significant usage time
  - Removed 10-second rounding that caused time loss
  - Improved polling frequency from 5s to 2s for better accuracy
  - Fixed initialization gaps and edge case handling
  - Enhanced Chrome tab detection with fallback handling

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Date-Based Data Organization
- Group activities by date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Calculate daily totals and statistics
- Handle timezone-aware day boundaries

### 2. Navigation Controls
- Previous/Next day buttons
- "Today" button to return to current day
- Date picker for jumping to specific dates
- Clear indication of which day is being viewed

### 3. Daily Statistics
- Total time tracked for the day
- Number of applications/websites used
- Productive vs unproductive time (when categorization is implemented)
- Session count and average session length

### 4. UI Improvements
- Date header showing selected day
- Daily summary cards
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Smooth loading transitions

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for consistency and sorting
2. **Day Boundaries**: Use local timezone for day calculations
3. **Default View**: Always start with today's data
4. **Data Storage**: Keep existing database schema, add date-based queries
5. **Navigation**: Simple Previous/Next buttons with date picker option
6. **Performance**: Calculate daily summaries on-demand (can optimize later)

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Daily Functionality (High Priority)
- Database functions for daily data
- Basic date navigation (Previous/Next/Today)
- Daily data display

### Milestone 2: Enhanced UI (Medium Priority)  
- Date picker component
- Daily statistics panel
- Improved visual design

### Milestone 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- Weekly/monthly aggregation views
- Data export for specific days
- Performance optimizations
