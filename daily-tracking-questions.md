# Daily Time Tracking - Clarification Questions

## UI/UX Questions

1. **Day Navigation Style**: 
   - Do you prefer a calendar-style date picker, or simple Previous/Next day buttons?
   - Should we show a mini calendar widget or just text-based navigation?

2. **Default View**: 
   - Should the app always open to "today" by default?
   - When viewing a previous day, should the app remember that selection on restart?

3. **Daily Statistics Display**:
   - What specific metrics should be shown for each day? (total time, productive time, app count, etc.)
   - Should we show a comparison with previous days or weekly averages?

4. **Data Retention**:
   - How far back should users be able to navigate? (unlimited, last 30 days, last year?)
   - Should there be any data archiving or cleanup features?

## Technical Questions

5. **Time Zone Handling**:
   - Should day boundaries be based on local time zone?
   - How should we handle activities that span midnight (continue on new day or split)?

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Should we pre-calculate daily summaries for faster loading?
   - How should we handle large amounts of historical data?

7. **Data Migration**:
   - Should existing data be automatically organized by days?
   - Do you want to preserve the current aggregated view as an "All Time" option?

## Feature Scope

8. **Additional Features**:
   - Should we add weekly/monthly views in addition to daily?
   - Do you want export functionality for specific days?
   - Should there be daily goals or targets?

9. **Integration with Existing Features**:
   - How should the reset data functionality work with daily views?
   - Should categorization and productivity tracking remain the same per day?

Please answer these questions so I can create a detailed implementation plan that matches your exact requirements.
