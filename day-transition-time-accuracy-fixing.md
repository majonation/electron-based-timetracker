# Day Transition and Time Accuracy Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified

### Bug 1: Day Transition Not Working
**Problem**: Application doesn't automatically start counting towards a new day when the date changes and the app is open for several days.

**Root Cause**: 
- `todayString` variable in `renderer.js` was set only once during initialization
- Auto-refresh logic only worked for the originally loaded day
- No detection of day changes during runtime

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added day change detection in `startAutoRefresh()` function
- Added day change detection in window focus handler  
- Automatic navigation to new day when day changes
- Updated navigation buttons when day changes
- Added console logging for debugging day transitions

### Bug 2: Time Counting Inaccuracy
**Problem**: Application counts and sums up too little time - not fully counting the entire time when application is active.

**Root Cause**:
- 10-second rounding (`floorTo10s` and `ceilTo10s`) caused time loss
- Initial gap when app starts (`lastRecordTime` was null)
- 5-second polling interval was too infrequent
- Missing time when no active window detected

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed 10-second rounding - now uses exact timestamps
- Added proper initialization with `trackingStartTime`
- Reduced polling interval from 5 seconds to 2 seconds
- Better handling of edge cases (no active window, Chrome tab detection failures)
- Minimum 1-second duration requirement to avoid noise
- Improved error handling to maintain tracking continuity

## Files Modified

### `/src/renderer.js`
- **`startAutoRefresh()`**: Added day change detection and automatic day switching
- **Window focus handler**: Added day change detection when app regains focus
- **Auto-refresh logic**: Now properly handles day transitions

### `/src/tracker.js`
- **Removed rounding functions**: `floorTo10s()` and `ceilTo10s()` 
- **Added tracking initialization**: `trackingStartTime` variable
- **Improved `pollActivity()`**: Better time accuracy, error handling, and edge case management
- **Reduced polling interval**: From 5 seconds to 2 seconds
- **Enhanced Chrome detection**: Fallback to Chrome app tracking when tab info unavailable

## Testing Recommendations

### Day Transition Testing
1. Start the app before midnight
2. Leave it running past midnight
3. Verify it automatically switches to the new day's tracking
4. Check that navigation buttons update correctly
5. Verify console shows day change detection messages

### Time Accuracy Testing
1. Use the app for known durations (e.g., 10 minutes on a specific app)
2. Compare tracked time with actual usage time
3. Test with rapid app switching
4. Test with Chrome website browsing
5. Verify time is properly attributed to correct days when crossing midnight

## Expected Improvements

1. **Day Transitions**: App will now automatically detect and switch to new days
2. **Time Accuracy**: Should track much closer to actual usage time (within ~2-3 seconds accuracy)
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and edge case management
4. **Performance**: More frequent polling for better accuracy without significant performance impact

## Monitoring

- Console logs will show day change detections
- Database entries should have more accurate timestamps
- Daily totals should more closely match actual usage patterns
